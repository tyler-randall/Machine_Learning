Population Growth Prediction

Overview

This project explores population growth predictions using two different machine learning models: Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The dataset contains population measurements over a series of days, and the goal is to predict population values based on this trend.

Features

Loads and preprocesses data from population_vs_day.csv

Implements Linear Regression for trend-based forecasting

Implements K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for pattern-based prediction

Splits the dataset into training and testing sets

Visualizes actual vs. predicted population values

Evaluates model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Installation

To run this project, install the required dependencies:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

Usage

Run the script using:

python population_prediction.py

The script will output:

A visualization comparing actual data with model predictions

MSE scores for both models

Visualization

The script generates a scatter plot showing actual population values and predictions from both models to compare performance.

Future Improvements

Experiment with additional regression models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests)

Tune hyperparameters for better accuracy

Incorporate external factors influencing population growth
